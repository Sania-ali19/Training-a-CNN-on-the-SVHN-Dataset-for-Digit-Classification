Project Report: Training a CNN on the SVHN Dataset for Digit Classification
1. Project Overview
This project aims to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify digits from images using the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. The CNN model is designed to identify and classify digits (0-9) from real-world images of house numbers. The project involves preprocessing the data, building and training a CNN, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

2. Literature Review
Article 1: Deep Learning for Image Classification: Recent Advances (2022): This article emphasizes the role of CNNs in image classification tasks, especially in handling real-world datasets like SVHN. It discusses the advantages of deep learning in automatically extracting spatial hierarchies of features from images and the latest advancements in CNN architectures, such as ResNet and EfficientNet, that boost performance and efficiency.

Article 2: Efficient Neural Networks for Image Classification in Real-World Scenarios (2023): This study explores lightweight CNN architectures for real-world, large-scale datasets such as SVHN. It highlights balancing model complexity with computational efficiency, focusing on architectures that maintain high classification accuracy with fewer parameters, suitable for deployment in constrained environments.

3. Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used throughout the project:

Python 3.8: The primary programming language for the project.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and handling data arrays.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization, plotting training curves, and visualizing image data.
Scikit-image: Used for image manipulation and handling.
TensorFlow/Keras: The deep learning framework used for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
SciPy: For loading the .mat files from the SVHN dataset.
Google Colab: The development environment used for running the model.
4. Dataset Details
Dataset Source: The SVHN dataset was used, which contains images of house number digits. It is similar in format to the MNIST dataset but has more complex real-world scenarios (e.g., cluttered background, varying lighting conditions).
Training Set Size: 73,257 images (32x32 pixels).
Test Set Size: 26,032 images (32x32 pixels).
Labeling: The dataset consists of 10 classes, with labels from 0 to 9.
Data Preprocessing:

The images were normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1 by dividing by 255.
The training and test labels were one-hot encoded, converting categorical labels into a binary matrix format.
5. Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used for the classification task consists of multiple convolutional layers with pooling layers, followed by dense (fully connected) layers. The final layer uses softmax activation to output the probabilities for each digit (0-9).

CNN Architecture:

Input Layer: 32x32x3 (RGB Image)
Conv Layer 1: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation, Max Pooling (2x2)
Conv Layer 2: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation, Max Pooling (2x2)
Conv Layer 3: 128 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation, Max Pooling (2x2)
Flatten: Converts the 3D feature maps into 1D vectors.
Dense Layer 1: 256 units, ReLU activation.
Dense Layer 2: 128 units, ReLU activation.
Output Layer: 11 units (softmax activation for classification).
Model Summary:

The model contains approximately 1.6 million parameters.
It is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
6. Hyperparameters
Optimizer: Adam
Learning Rate: 0.001
Batch Size: 64
Epochs: 5 (Can be increased for better performance)
7. Evaluation Metrics
The model was evaluated based on:

Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly classified digits.
Loss: The cross-entropy loss between the true labels and predicted probabilities.
Training Results:

Training Accuracy: 95.6%
Validation Accuracy: 92.8%
Training Loss: 0.152
Validation Loss: 0.217
Loss Curves: The loss and accuracy curves demonstrate that the model learned well during training. A small degree of overfitting was observed, as the validation loss is slightly higher than the training loss.

8. Analysis of Results
The CNN model achieved high accuracy in both training and testing, indicating its effectiveness for digit classification in real-world images. The validation accuracy (92.8%) shows that the model generalizes well to unseen data, although the slight difference between training and validation accuracy suggests that some degree of overfitting exists.

9. Visualizing Model Predictions
A subset of 50 random test images was selected, and the predicted and true labels were visualized. The results showed that the model was able to correctly classify most images, with occasional misclassifications. These misclassifications were often due to ambiguous or noisy images.

10. Possible Improvements
Increase Epochs: Increasing the number of epochs could potentially improve the modelâ€™s performance and reduce the gap between training and validation accuracy.
Data Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping could be applied to augment the dataset, introducing more variability and helping the model generalize better.
Regularization: Dropout layers and L2 regularization can be introduced to reduce overfitting.
Batch Normalization: Adding batch normalization layers between the convolutional layers could help stabilize learning and improve model performance.
Explore Deeper Architectures: Experimenting with deeper networks such as ResNet or VGG could further enhance performance, especially on noisy and complex datasets like SVHN.
